/**
 * Issue #344 – QuidError → human-readable UI string mapping.
 *
 * Error codes are defined in:
 *   quid-contract/contracts/quid-store/src/error.rs
 *
 * The numeric codes come from the Soroban contract error enum and are
 * surfaced in failed transaction result bodies.  The frontend parses the
 * error code from the transaction result and maps it to a user-facing
 * message using this module.
